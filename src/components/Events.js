                The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
                Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] <br />
                The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals,{" "}
                <br /> traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short
                breaks. <br /> Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the
                Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer
                that Cirillo used as a university student. <br />
                The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and
                websites providing timers and instructions. <br /> Closely
                related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and
                incremental development used in software design, the method has
                been adopted in pair programming contexts.
